Let me post my details for you now.

I'm looking for someone who can build me a EVM compatible layer1 blockchain. Forking eth pos is fine. I want the entire DeFI suite.
>>>>>>>> OK Fork of heco-chain recommended which is HPoS , hybrid proof of stake
Blockchain needs to have the following:
• I need my own ticker and native token on the chain. Plan to launch contracts/tokens for people to buy.
>>>>>>>> OK 
• Prevent snipers from the mempool and front running bots
>>>>>>>> OK , It needs extra efforts to work inside go-ethereum source.
• contract verification to be mandatory. I would alsoøto add a honey pot checker, etc to the verification process.
>>>>>>>> OK , It needs extra efforts to work inside go-ethereum source.
• Instead of renouncing, make it mandatory to lock a contract within a smart contract. A governance decides if the dev can unlock his contract.
>>>>>>>> OK , is it only for DeFi suite or for all contracts of the system ?
• Mandatory 7 day liquidity lock.
>>>>>>>> OK, 
• I need a testnet with a faucet
>>>>>>>> OK,
Fullly functional blockchain explorer (blockscout) that appears like etherscan.io
>>>>>>>> OK,
Fork of kibaswap https://github.com/TheKibaInu/kibaswap
>>>>>>>> OK,
Dex similar to https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer
>>>>>>>> OK,
Token/Liquidty locker.
>>>>>>>> OK,
Launchpad for easy contract launch for non-devs
>>>>>>>> OK, A complete UI,Web application need to develop for it , If for Defi only the fine

Project overview
The project is meant to replace the Ethereum meme coin space. I want a safe blockchain for people to have fun on and not be scammed.

ability to lock a contract within a smart contract, instead of renouncing. A governance decides if the dev can unlock the token
>>>>>>>> Repeat of above

I have this project partially functional already...http://5.161.150.179:4000/
>>>>>>>> OK, others work may raise incompatibility issue with other components which may waste lots of time 
You built Dithereum?
>>>>>>>> Yes, I did only miner,rpc, bootnode parts , other components were compled by other team members, but no issue we are capable to compile with Ajit Jha

Dithereum is the ecosystem I want, but with my specifications.
>>>>>>>> OK
I just need the bare minimum by end of year. Then continue to work on it to make it a safe blockchain so people can't be scammed.
>>>>>>>> OK, So we need to decide terms and conditions to work for it, however many go fork projects (20+) we have completed under the roof of GDO, some of them are exactly same which you wants to offfer the world, If you are looking for a really innovative idea of 'complete blockchain based Defi systems with no centerlized control' and you have enough capacity/team to invest and market for the same , I have clear idea/vision for it, we can discuss for it if interested for terms/conditions/shares regarding this to jointly shock the world to left all competitors behind.
